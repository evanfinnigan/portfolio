      p This project was created for CS 4482: Game Engines, taught by Kailey Joanette at The University of Western Ontario.
      p Aerial Firefighting is a basic game demo made in Unity. It is programmed in C#. The player controls a rescue plane which must put out forest fires in order to save the forests and towns on the island. The playerâ€™s score is based on how much of the landscape remains in tact after all the fire is out.
      p The map in the game is divided into a grid, and each tile of the grid has a type. The types include water, forest, and town. Water tiles allow the player to replenish the players water supply. Forest tiles and Town tiles may catch fire, and must be saved inorder to gain points. At the beginning of the game, some of the Forest tiles are on Fire, and as time goes on these fires have a chance of spreading to adjacent tiles. If a tile is on fire for long enough, it will become burnt, and the player will not gain points from that tile.
      p This was an interesting and fun project for me. Some cool features of the game include procedural terrain generation, a dynamic skybox, and dynamic lighting based on the time of day in game.
