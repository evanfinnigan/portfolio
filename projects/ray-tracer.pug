      p A project implementing a ray-traced graphics engine, capable of rendering 3D geometry in a scene with lighting, reflections, and refractions.
      ul(style='text-align: left')
        li Ray intersection of 3D Geomerty: spheres, cubes, cylinders, and planes, as well as transformations of these shapes
        li Implemented reflections and refractions for different types of material
        li
          | Implemented Phong reflection model lighting techniques:
          ul
            li Ambient Shading
            li Diffuse Reflection
            li Specular Reflection
      p I did this project a number of years ago, so I am currently trying to locate the correct project files. When I locate them, I will take a real screenshot of the program and spare everybody from looking at this awful photo. For now, this was all I could find, a picture I sent to a friend while working on the project.
      p I actually have a few more photos from the conversation, of various bugs and glitches I encountered. Maybe I'll post some of those. Working on a graphics engine can produce some interesting unintended results.
