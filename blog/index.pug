        h2 Update!
        p 03/10/2019
        p Hello again!
        p
          | I've been offline for the summer, enjoying a lovely life outdoors as a member of the Resource Team at 
          a(href='https://canterburyhillscamp.ca/') Canterbury Hills
          | . As such I've neglected this website, so I figure it's time for some updating.
        p
          | Slowly I plan to publish some little projects I've worked on in the past, along with new ones as they come along. To start, I have added a dumb little 
          a(href='../projects/fidget.html') Fidget-Spinner
          |  toy that I made in PICO-8 a while back, mostly as a joke for my friends, when fidget-spinners were trending.
        p
          | I've been busy recently working on a business project with a close friend of mine, which we have pitched to 
          a(href='https://www.ycombinator.com/') Y Combinator
          | . It's been interesting to dip my toes in the water learning how to make a web application, as I haven't really done any web development in the past for school or for work. I'm building the prototype with Node.js and Express. I might follow up with more about that project at a later date, but that's what I'm up to at the moment.

        h2 List Ranking Demo
        p 07/05/2019
        p Hey everybody,
        p
          | I have created a small demo application following the recent tier-list ranking craze. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you can find the original 
          a(href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8lRlYdzmMY') Fast Food Tier List
          |  by iDubbbz, and some other good examples 
          a(href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojo7sRcGFlY') here
          |  and 
          a(href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUU1HOj7o2k') here
          | . The idea to make an easier ranking platform was suggested to me by my close friend Isaac, so I put together a quick proof-of-concept.
