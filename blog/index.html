				<h2>Update!</h2>
				<p>03/10/2019</p>
				<p>Hello again!</p>
				<p>I've been offline for the summer, enjoying a lovely life outdoors as a member of the Resource Team at <a href="https://canterburyhillscamp.ca/">Canterbury Hills</a>. As such I've neglected this website, so I figure it's time for some updating.</p>
				<p>Slowly I plan to publish some little projects I've worked on in the past, along with new ones as they come along. To start, I have added a dumb little <a href="../projects/fidget.html">Fidget-Spinner</a> toy that I made in PICO-8 a while back, mostly as a joke for my friends, when fidget-spinners were trending. </p>
				<p>I've been busy recently working on a business project with a close friend of mine, which we have pitched to <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>. It's been interesting to dip my toes in the water learning how to make a web application, as I haven't really done any web development in the past for school or for work. I'm building the prototype with Node.js and Express. I might follow up with more about that project at a later date, but that's what I'm up to at the moment.</p>
				<p>✌☮️❤️</p>

				<h2>List Ranking Demo</h2>
				<p>07/05/2019</p>
				<p>Hey everybody,</p>
				<p>I have created a small demo application following the recent tier-list ranking craze. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you can find the original <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8lRlYdzmMY">Fast Food Tier List</a> by iDubbbz, and some other good examples <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojo7sRcGFlY">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUU1HOj7o2k">here</a>. The idea to make an easier ranking platform was suggested to me by my close friend Isaac, so I put together a quick proof-of-concept.</p>
				<p><a href="../projects/list/index.html">Try the demo</a> and have fun &#128526;</p>
