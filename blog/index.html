        <h2>Pug & New Projects</h2>
        <p>22/01/2020</p>
        <p>I've updated this website, so it now uses <a href="https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html">pug</a> template code to render the HTML. This allows for code reuse and ease of maintenance. I'm using pug locally using the pug-cli and a bash script, which allows me to keep the website as static using simple HTML files, and eliminates the need for a web server.</p>
        <p>I used a tool called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/html2pug">html2pug</a> along with a bash script to transform my hand-written HTML into pug templates. This was extremely helpful, as it meant I didn't have to rewrite my entire website in a new language. I then cleaned up the pug files to make sure they worked correctly, and did some refactoring and moved common code into separate pug files and mixins.
          I like this new project structure, and I think it may be helpful for others, so I might go into more detail in a future tutorial.
        </p>
        <p>In other news, I recently participated in the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/wowie-jam">Wowie! Game Jam</a>. I use the term <em>participated</em> somewhat loosely, as I didn't actually submit my game. I ended up having to work over the weekend, so I wasn't able to finish. I'm ok with not having submitted the project though, as I mostly just wanted to shake off the rust and get some practise, since I've recently been busy applying to jobs and haven't taken enough time to work on projects.
          I will probably be uploading the game here soon, so look out for something piano-related in the <a href="/projects">projects</a> section. I plan to do more game jams and small-scope projects in the near future, and hopefully can work on some useful new tutorials.

        <h2>Update!</h2>
        <p>03/10/2019</p>
        <p>Hello again!</p>
        <p>I've been offline for the summer, enjoying a lovely life outdoors as a member of the Resource Team at <a href="https://canterburyhillscamp.ca/">Canterbury Hills</a>. As such I've neglected this website, so I figure it's time for some updating.</p>
        <p>Slowly I plan to publish some little projects I've worked on in the past, along with new ones as they come along. To start, I have added a dumb little <a href="../projects/fidget.html">Fidget-Spinner</a> toy that I made in PICO-8 a while back, mostly as a joke for my friends, when fidget-spinners were trending.</p>
        <p>I've been busy recently working on a business project with a close friend of mine, which we have pitched to <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>. It's been interesting to dip my toes in the water learning how to make a web application, as I haven't really done any web development in the past for school or for work. I'm building the prototype with Node.js and Express. I might follow up with more about that project at a later date, but that's what I'm up to at the moment.</p>

        <h2>List Ranking Demo</h2>
        <p>07/05/2019</p>
        <p>Hey everybody,</p>
        <p>I have created a small demo application following the recent tier-list ranking craze. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you can find the original <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8lRlYdzmMY">Fast Food Tier List</a> by iDubbbz, and some other good examples <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojo7sRcGFlY">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUU1HOj7o2k">here</a>. The idea to make an easier ranking platform was suggested to me by my close friend Isaac, so I put together a quick proof-of-concept.</p>
        <p><a href="../projects/list/index.html">Try the demo</a> and have fun üòé</p>
