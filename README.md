## My Professional Portfolio [Website](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)

I'm currently looking for job opportunities as a software developer. Hire me!

## Master Branch

This branch contains the source code, which is written in [pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)

These pug template files are rendered to HTML via pug-cli locally, then uploaded to the gh-pages branch.
This process is automated with a local bash script so that the pug source and the rendered html live in two 
seperate directories and can both use version control without exposing the pug files to the web domain.
