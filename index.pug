          p At RP4K, I taught math & programming to students between grade 2 and grade 10. I love teaching and really enjoyed being able to share my knowledge. I was able to help students understand concepts from linear algebra and beyond, and we applied those concepts to the fun and creative task of making games.

        p Language: Java
        p This project was a simple desktop weather application, in which users can input a location and will recieve hourly, daily, and weekly forecasts. You can also see the weather on Mars, and save data such as favourite locations or search history.
        p This group project was one of the first GUI applications I worked on, and was the first software project (other than some small console programs) that we created without any starter code from instructors. It was my first time using an external API, dealing with JSON data, building a UI in Java, using a build system (maven), and my first group project making software in University.
